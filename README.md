# SpeakUp AI

This is a simple web app that helps users practice English conversation.
The main page is `index.html` which loads language files from the `lang` folder
and uses a small custom stylesheet `style.css` for UI tweaks and animations.

Open `index.html` in a browser to try it out. You can click the star next to any message during a conversation to save it as a favorite.
